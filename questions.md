Q1.How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
Answer -> I spent around 8 hours building the CRUD, design, and dynamic section using the MVC framework (CodeIgniter). With more time, I would add proper error messages, integrate DevExtreme DataGrid or jQuery DataTable for searchable and sortable listings, and implement user authentication for CRUD operations.

Q2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer -> Yes, I have. I tracked it by checking server logs, reviewing slow database queries, and in one project used AWS autoscaling to add new EC2 instances when CPU usage hit the limit.
